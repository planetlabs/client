## @planet/client

A JavaScript client for [Planet's imagery API](https://www.planet.com/docs/).  See the [client API docs](http://planetlabs.github.io/client/api/) for detail on using the package.

### Installation

The `@planet/client` requires Node >= 0.12.  Install the `@planet/client` package `npm` (which comes with [Node](https://nodejs.org/)).

    npm install @planet/client

The `@planet/client` package provides a library for use in your application and a `planet` executable for command line use.  See details on both below.

### Using the Library

The `@planet/client` package can be used in a Node based project or in the browser with a CommonJS module loader (like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)).

It is also possible to load a standalone bundle of the library in a script tag.  Without a module loader, this will create a global `planet` object:

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@planet/client/dist/planet.js"></script>

This will redirect to the most recent release.  To avoid the redirect, you can include a specific version number (e.g. https://unpkg.com/@planet/client@2.0.0/dist/planet.js).

The library requires a global [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) implementation.  This comes with Node >= 0.12 and [modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=promise).  To use `@planet/client` in an environment without `Promise`, you can [use a polyfill](https://www.google.com/search?q=promise+polyfill).

See the [API docs](http://planetlabs.github.io/client/api/) for detail on using the package.

### Contributing

To get set up, clone the repository and install the development dependencies:

    git clone git@github.com:planetlabs/client.git
    cd client
    npm install

#### Running the tests

The tests are run in a browser and in Node.  You can run the linter and all tests once with the following:

    npm test

To start a file watcher that runs the linter and tests with any file changes:

    npm start

With the `npm start` task running, you can attach any number of browsers to the [test server](http://localhost:9876/).  Every time you attach a new browser, tests run in all browsers.  To debug any failing test, visit the test runner [debug page](http://localhost:9876/debug.html) and open your development console.

#### Building the docs

The project docs are generated from templates in the `doc` directory.  The API docs are generated based on annotations in comments throughout the `api` modules.  You can build the docs with the following task:

    npm run doc

You can view the doc output in the `build/doc` directory.

*Note* - Building the docs requires Node >= 8.0.

#### Publishing a release

Releases are published from the master branch.  To cut a new minor release, do this:

    npm version minor && git push --tags origin master && npm publish

The `postpublish` script will update the hosted version of [the docs](http://planetlabs.github.io/client/).

*Note* - Publishing a release requires Node >= 8.0.
